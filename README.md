# ember-cli-vtkui

The `ember-cli-vtkui` project is an EmberJS Addon focused on providing components and styling to support a team's desire to incrementally replace legacy GWT / GXT UI code with standalone EmberJS applications.

The end goal would be to target [Ember-Engines](https://github.com/dgeb/ember-engines) as a full GWT/GXT replacement.
